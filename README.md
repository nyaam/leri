# Leri Analytics
[Leri Analytics](https://godzilla.uchicago.edu/pages/ngaam/leri/index.html) aims to provide bioinformatics services for and solutions to both academic labs and industries. Leri delivers better custom solutions in the fileds of 
- *in silico* protein folding & design ([Sibe](https://godzilla.uchicago.edu/pages/ngaam/sibe/index.html))
- NGS data analysis
- population genomics
- statistical analysis on data
- deep learning & optimization
- as well as other omic data analysis.

Leri Analytics delivers the most accurate solutions to your research and industrial applications. Understanding the specific purpose of your project, we will try our best to provide standard pipelines that particularly developed for your project, the best solutions, and the detailed analytical reports.
